# Workspace level `.vscode` for [jellyfin-plugin-sso](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso)

Per [jellyfin-plugin-sso#17](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/issues/17), for now we'll avoid committing
any IDE specific artifacts.

I personally don't know that I agree with this, since I think `vscode` is lightweight & ubiquitous enough to be worth
supporting, and giving development workflows is useful to reducing friction in onboarding, but I respect the owner's wishes.

This repo literally just provides some vscode workflows, settings and extension recommendations for the project.

## Usage

1. clone/fork [https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso)
2. `cd jellyfin-plugin-sso`
3. clone this `git clone https://github.com/matthewstrasiotto/jellyfin-plugin-sso-vscode .vscode`

Feel free to fork this for your own changes or whatever you wanna do with it really.
